            <h2>Etching</h2>
            <p class="sub">I began by preparing a copper plate and covering it with a ground layer, then carefully scratching out my design to reveal the metal beneath. 
                After etching the plate in acid, I refined the details through multiple rounds of mark making. Finally, I inked and wiped the plate, printing the design onto paper.

            <p class="sub">
                Monotype was the first printmaking technique I learned. 
                It introduced me to the basics of inking, plate preparation, and the surprise element of pulling an unique print, 
                it's really a exploration balance between control and experimentation.

            <p class="sub">
                The net texture on green background is made by monotype, the spiders and fish is made by a technique called paper lithography.
                The second prints is a guost print of the first one, making the net textures identical but opposite in colors. 
                I really like paper lithography, I am able to catch tiny details in the image.

                This print series explores the relationship between inner reflection and the external world.
                The meditating girl and her thought bubble act as a frame, it's made by an etching plate.
                Different scenes of background leaves flexibility for my creativity.
                The techniques I used includes monotype layers, viscosity rolls on the plate, and lithography details.
