      <p>I was texting my boyfriend and reminding him what we need to buy from Costco. 
        I quickly realized that <strong>shopping list gets override by other texts</strong>, making it hard to track. 
        We both likes to use voice message because it's <strong>faster and it frees your hand from typing.</strong> 
        But at the same time, it takes more time to listen than reading the texts. The idea of VoiceNote formed, <strong>converting voices to texts and shares it automatically.</strong>

            I captured a LOT of screenshots of my challenges and ideas to AI models. 
            It's a bit chaos because I have to ask and learn a lot of things from scratch. I definitely learned a lot, from what is database to how it works, and setting up step by step, but I don't fully understand the logic behinds it. 
            Samething happen in functional coding, I realized that relying on AI to code isn't the best practice for a beginner, I think it's better to learn the basic logic of the language first and code with AI's help.
